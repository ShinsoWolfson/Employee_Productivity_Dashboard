## **Steps Taken**  

### 1. **Data Cleaning**  
- Inspected the dataset for missing or inconsistent values, ensuring high data quality.  
- Applied transformations to standardize formats, such as datetime normalization for accurate time-based analysis.  
- Conducted data validation checks to maintain consistency across metrics and ensure reliable downstream analysis.  

### 2. **Data Analysis**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
  - Explored distributions of key variables, such as tasks completed and average productivity per hour.  
  - Aggregated data by departments and employees to identify performance trends and outliers.  
  - Analyzed correlations between productivity metrics and potential influencing factors.  
- **Key Metrics Derived:** 
  - Created custom metrics, such as "Tasks per Hour" and departmental averages, for a deeper understanding of productivity at both macro and micro levels.  
  - Used advanced grouping and filtering to dissect performance across various organizational dimensions.

### 3. **Data Visualization**  
- Leveraged **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create impactful, clean, and visually appealing charts.  
- Designed charts such as bar plots, scatter plots, and line graphs to represent employee performance and departmental productivity effectively.  
- Sampled large datasets for better readability without losing analytical depth, making visualizations more interpretable for stakeholders.  
- Integrated color palettes like `viridis` and `mako` to enhance aesthetics and differentiate between data points.
